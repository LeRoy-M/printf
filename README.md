The functions in the printf() family produce output according to a format as described below.  The functions printf() and vprintk() write output to stdout, the standard outputstream;
Format of the format string
       The format string is a character string, beginning and ending in its initial shift state, if any.  The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not %), which are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments.  Each conversion specification is introduced by the character %, and ends with a conversion specifier.

This _printf project is handled by LeRoy Mzughula and Jamal Salat.
